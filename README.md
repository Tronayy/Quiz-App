# Quiz-App

An application that generates 10 random questions from an API and then asks the user to choose the correct answer out of 4 options. The application then displays the final score of the user and asks if he/she wants to give it another go.

The app makes use of the following:
1. Reactjs
2. React-bootstrap
3. CSS
4. React hooks
5. Open Trivia DB API https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

This is my first personal project on React JS. 

Here is the link to the deployed app: https://tronayyquizz.netlify.app/
