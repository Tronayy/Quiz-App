#Quiz-App

An application that generates 10 random questions from an API and then asks the user to choose the correct answer out of 4 options. The application then displays the final score of the user and asks if he/she wants to give it another go.

This is my first personal project on React JS. I've used React-Bootstrap to create the card and some buttons. Other than that, everything is designed through simple CSS. I've used the useState hook for keeping state and also transferring state to the other components.
